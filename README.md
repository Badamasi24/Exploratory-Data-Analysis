# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
As part of my Data Analysis internship, I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on a Stock Price dataset containing historical stock prices for the S&amp;P 500 companies. This project focuses on identifying price distributions, detecting market outliers, and understanding the correlation between different trading metrics using Python.
